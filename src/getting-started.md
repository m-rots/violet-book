# Getting started

## Installation

Installing `Violet` is just a simple `pip install` away.

```shell
$ pip install -U "git+https://github.com/m-rots/violet.git@main"
```

Please do note that `Violet` requires `Python` 3.9 or later.

## Quick start

Below we show a simple snippet that creates a new simulation, adds multiple agents and then runs the simulation.

```python
from vi import Agent, Simulation

(
    Simulation()
    .batch_spawn_agents(Agent, image_paths=["images/white.png"])
    .run()
)
```

The snippet above will add 100 instances of the `Agent` class to the simulation,
with each agent defaulting to the first image, which is `white.png`.
All agents are positioned randomly and automatically wander through the environment.

## Agent quick start

To add custom logic to your agents, you can inherit the `Agent` class and override the `update` method by your own.

```python
from vi import Agent, BaseConfig, Simulation


class MyAgent(Agent):
    def update(self):
        if len(self.in_radius()) > 0:
            self.image = self.images[1]
        else:
            self.image = self.images[0]


(
    Simulation(BaseConfig(chunk_size=25))
    .batch_spawn_agents(
        MyAgent,  # ðŸ‘ˆ use our own MyAgent class
        image_paths=[
            "examples/images/white.png",
            "examples/images/red.png",
        ],
    )
    .run()
)
```

Here we create a new class called `MyAgent` in which we inherit `Agent`.
We inherit the `Agent` class so that our agent is drawn to the screen automatically.

In our `update` function we check whether there are any agents close to our current agent.
If there is at least one agent nearby, we change our image to index `1` of the `image_paths` list, in this case resulting in us selecting `red.png`.
However, if no one is around, we revert the image back to `white.png`.

Last but not least we make sure to spawn our newly created `MyAgent` class inside the `batch_spawn_agents` function.
In addition, we change the radius (the agent's visibility) from the default of 50 pixels to 25 pixels by modifying the `chunk_size` configuration value.
